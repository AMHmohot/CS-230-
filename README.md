The client from the Gaming Room was hoping for a web tool that teams could use to input their replies based on what they saw. The Gaming Room customer sought to broaden its reach beyond its initial Android platform by developing a web application. Win, Lose or Draw, a game popular in the 1980s, was the inspiration for the client's app. Keeping costs down was another goal for the customer. In particular, I feel that I succeeded in comprehending and conveying the client's desires and needs for their game. I found that clearly understanding the client's main needs was really helpful when writing the code. You make it easier for me to understand what I'm dealing with by providing me with a clear list. Knowing the benefits and drawbacks of designing for different operating systems jumps out to me, even if I feel like I need to alter almost all of my work. I believe this is a crucial component in fully understanding what to look out for and what factors to examine.   
According to my understanding, the user's requirement is something that must always be my first priority. Every time I make a design, I have to consider how the user might respond. Essentially, it's about adopting the user's perspective, as failing to address their demands would render the entire endeavor useless. I need to think about who will be using the project, not just myself. Less traffic means less money for the client to spend on site maintenance if it's too difficult for users to utilize. One of my primary goals while creating software is to maximize the project's storage and memory efficiency. Several issues can arise from developing software that uses many resources from the sources. To better understand my thought process and goals for building something comparable, I believe one approach I would use is to first write out pseudocodes. It is also extremely necessary to debug the project and perform unit tests.
